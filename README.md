# 🌟 Eleeter Discord Bot Template 🌟
 
This little project is perfect if you’re just starting out with bots, want something clean to learn from, and have some fun with Discord.  

It comes with a **leveling system**, **leaderboards**, **FAQ commands**, and **predefined responses** — all ready to go. You just need to plug in your bot token and channels! 🚀

## What This Bot Can Do

**Leveling System**  
- Earn XP for every message you send.  
- Level-up messages in a channel you choose.  
- Built-in cooldowns so it doesn’t spam.  

**Leaderboard**  
- See the top 10 users by level.  
- Cooldown included to prevent spam.  

**FAQ System**  
- Type `!faq` to see answers to common questions.  
- Slash command `/faq` supported too.  

**Predefined Responses**  
- Your bot can respond automatically to certain words/phrases.  
- Stored in `responses.json` so you can edit them anytime.  

**Safe Token Handling**  
- Your bot token is stored in an environment variable (`DISCORD_TOKEN`). No need to hardcode it.
